// A forest fire has been spotted at fire, a simple 2-element array with x, y coordinates.

// The forest service has decided to send smoke jumpers in by plane and drop them in the forest.

// The terrain is dangerous and surveyors have determined that there are three possible safe dropzones, an array of three simple arrays with x, y coordinates.

// The plane is en route and time is of the essence. Your mission is to return a simple [x,y] array with the coordinates of the dropzone closest to the fire.

// If several dropzones are an equal distance away from the fire, then return the first closest dropzone in the given array.

// For example, if you are given: fire = [1,1], dropzones = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,2]], the answer is [0,1], because that is the first closest dropzone in the given array.

const fire = [2, 2];
const dropzones = [
  [0, 1],
  [1, 2],
  [2, 3],
];

function dropzone(fire, dropzones) {
    // if (dropzones[0][0])
    console.log(dropzones[2][1]);
    
}

dropzone(fire, dropzones);
